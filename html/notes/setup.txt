you must first add a file called loc.php containing:
<?php
	$web_dir = "{}/"
?>

where {} is the path from the url root to your subdir.  For instance, if you want the web dir to end up at http://ucsf-205-202.ucsf.edu/lcgerke, replace {} with lcgerke.

next, add a symbolic link from html/:
ln -s /home/gfp/images
