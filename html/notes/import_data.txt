from adam:

Order for perl scripts to populate the database:



importorfs.pl (this has to be first)

importoligos.pl

importconditionstain.pl

importcheckprimers.pl

importrefimages.pl



The oligos and checkprimers scripts will throw some errors for missing
orfs, but they still run and will do their job. 



The refimages script requires a folder full of pictures, from which it
will grab the names to populate the subcell table. It should be in the
same folder as the script when it is run (I think it\'s there now).



I would definitely make a quick check of the scripts to be sure that
they address the recent additions -- particularly for the orfs and
strains table.
